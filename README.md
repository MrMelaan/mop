# Mop | Overhauled Progression
```ALPHA | Version: 1.0```

<hr>

*The focus of this mod is to redo base Terraria progression while adding a flavorful twist by adding custom content, the main goal here is to incentivise using overlooked weapons because they're* ***bad*** *with how progression is currently layered out and extend overall playtime of the game.*

*Despite being a mod that strives to enhance progression, it also adds a variety of custom content such as Weapons, Consumables, Armor, Crafting Stations, Hunger Mechanic, Farming, re-Imagined cooking, Bosses, and much more.*
